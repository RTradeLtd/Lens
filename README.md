# Lens

Lens is an opt-in search engine and data collection tool to aid content discovery of the distributed web.

Currently we only support indexing of textual data, which we accomplish via `textrank`. Additional analyzers, and supported formats will be added over time.


## Textual Processing

The only language supported is english (for the moment) however we can easily add new language with packages like https://github.com/stopwords-iso
