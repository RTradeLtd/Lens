# gotools

This package is set up as recommended in
[this guide](https://github.com/go-modules-by-example/index/blob/master/010_tools/README.md).

All Go code generation tasks should be able to be triggered by this command:

```
go generate ./...
```

See the [`go generate`](https://blog.golang.org/generate) documentation for how
to set this up.

Specific tools are documented in [`./tools.go`](./tools.go).
